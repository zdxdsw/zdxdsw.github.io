        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>I do not understand what is shown by the image</b><br>
            For each image, we additionally provide image title, one-sentence description and Wikipedia page url. 
            Please check these by clicking the "Show more image info" button and hope they help. 
            Also, feel free to search online for external information about relevant objects, places, architectures, events, etc.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>There is no definitive answer to this question</b><br>
            Do avoid subjective questions where different person might give different answers. And the correct answer should hold for a relatively long period, without changing from time to time.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>It is hard to come up with a question for any of the given image</b><br>
            This is very natural. Please check the examples we provided and see if they open up your mind. In addition, if you find a prompt really challenging, please tell us in the feedback field!</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>How can I use external information such as the image description or Wikipedia page? </b><br>
            You can assume that the question-answering system have access to the image title/description/Wikipedia page as you do. Thus, you can mention those external information in the question. However, the answer must be in the image. 
            For example, given an image of a coffee shop interior without showing the coffee shop's name, if you learn from its text description that this is Pacific Coffee, then you can directly ask about Pacific Coffee in your question. 
            However, you can't ask about something like "what is the name of the coffee shop", because the answer does not lie in the image.
        </li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>I'm not sure I understand the requirement "no referential phrases directly referring to image".</b><br>
            An easy way to check whether a question satisfies this requirement is to imagine someone asks you the question <b>without</b> providing any images, then think about whether you are able to fully understand what it is asking.
        </li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>There are multiple correct answers to my question.</b><br>
            It is fine that your question have multiple correct answers and a single image only supports one of them. For example, "which airlines have human figures on their airplane tail logo?" and "which parks in pittsburgh have fountains?" are nice.
            In fact, this is also a path toward a multi-image question! <br>
            In case you find this a bit contradictory to the "definitive answer" requirement, I would like to clarify that multiple correct answers are acceptable, but the <b>correctness</b> of one answer must not be subjective or time-sensitive.
