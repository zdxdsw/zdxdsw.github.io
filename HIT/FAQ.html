        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>I do not understand what is shown by the image</b><br>
            For each image, we additionally provide image title, one-sentence description and Wikipedia page url. 
            Please check these by clicking the "Show more image info" button and hope they help. 
            Also, feel free to search online for external information about relevant objects, places, architectures, events, etc.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>There is no definitive answer to this question</b><br>
            Do avoid subjective questions where different person might give different answers. And the correct answer should hold for a relatively long period, without changing from time to time.</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>It is hard to come up with a question for any of the given image</b><br>
            This is very natural. For now, you may like to check out the examples we provided and see if they open up your mind. 
            <br>Since this is a pilot study on a novel problem, no attempts have been made before to collect a dataset similar to this task. 
            We are still trying to figure out what type of images are more likely to ask questions about. 
            Please bear with us if you encounter "bad" images. Just try your best! We really appreciate your help.
            If you have any thoughts on what kind of images are potentially more suitable for this task, please tell us in the feedback field!

        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>I'm not sure I understand the requirement "no referential phrases directly referring to image".</b><br>
            An easy way to check whether a question satisfies this requirement is to imagine someone asks you the question <b>without</b> providing any images, then think about whether you are able to fully understand what it is asking.
        </li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>There are multiple correct answers to my question.</b><br>
            It is fine that your question have multiple correct answers and a single image only supports one of them. For example, "which airlines have human figures on their airplane tail logo?" and "which parks in pittsburgh have fountains?" are nice.
            In fact, this is also a path toward a multi-image question! <br>
            In case you find this a bit contradictory to the "definitive answer" requirement, I would like to clarify that multiple correct answers are acceptable, but the <b>correctness</b> of one answer must not be subjective or time-sensitive.
        </li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top:5px;"><b>How am I supposed to use the textual metadata such as filename and image description shown on the wikipedia page?</b><br>
            It is okay to refer to filenames or image descriptions in order to explicitly name things when you are asking a question. But make sure that the answer can be inferred from visual clues instead of the textual metadata.
            For example, given an image of a coffee shop interior without showing the coffee shop's name, if you learn from its text description that this is Pacific Coffee, then you can directly ask about Pacific Coffee in your question. 
            However, you can't ask about something like "what is the name of the coffee shop", because the answer does not lie in the image.<br>
