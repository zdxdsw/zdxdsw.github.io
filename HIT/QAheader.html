<strong>Hi!</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mar 10 update: </strong> Incorporating Turkers's feedback, we've made the following updates to the interface.
        <ul>
            <li><span style="color:rgb(1, 158, 67);"><strong>Backup set: </strong></span>We totally understand that occationally the image prompts are too bad to yield meaningful annotations. 
                Since there is technical difficulty to let you "skip a assignment", we add a "backup set" for each assignment. 
                Feel free to toggle between the original set and the backup set but you can't use both at the same time.
            </li>
            <li><span style="color:rgb(1, 158, 67);"><strong>Thumbnail images: </strong></span>Previouly we mentioned the image indexing mistake. In order to alleviate this problem, we make a thumbnail show up once you select an image index. 
                Note that if you switch to the "backup set", the thumbnails would change accordingly! 
                Please double check whether your image selections are correct before you submit. Thank you in advance!
            </li>
            <li>We'd really appreciate it if you could tell us in feedback whether the "backup set" or "thumbnail image" idea works well!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <br>
    <li>Just a friendly reminder that the optional survey's prompt was updated on Mar 09! Looking forward to seeing nice responses from you!</li>
    <li>For those buildings/people/streets... names, copying them from Wikipedia pages is fine but we want to restrict the dataset to <span style="color:rgb(218, 1, 1);">latin characters</span>. Thank you so much! </li>
    <li>We find that some Turkers are making mistakes with image indexes. This would propagate error to our post-processing stage and your super nice annotations could be lost! 
        So please double check that you are selecting the correct image indexes! Images 1,2,3 are in the first row and images 4,5,6 are in the second row. Thank you so much! 
    </li>
    <li><span style="color:rgb(0, 98, 255);">We are actively finding new turkers because we're trying to scale up the dataset by an order of magnitude. 
        We'd appreciate it if you could try and get more turkers do our qualification task. Thank you in advance!</span><br>

    </li>
    <li>Mouse hover over an image doubles its size! We hope this may save you some time for opening a new tab.</li>
    <li>Please select <b>exactly two</b> images for the "multi-image" annotation. (optional for annotation 1 & 2, required for annotation 3) </li>
    <li>We are still experimenting with pricing, so please bear with us as we adjust price between runs.</li>
    <li>We are currently assuming 10-15 min / task, but we will try and adjust appropriately!</li>
</ul>
<br>
Please let us know if any aspect of this HIT is unclear. We will try and iterate together.<br>
