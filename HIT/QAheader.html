<strong>Hi!</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mar 09 update</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Just a friendly reminder that we've updated the optional survey's prompt! Looking forward to seeing nice responses from you!</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <br>
    <li>For those buildings/people/streets... names, copying them from Wikipedia pages is fine but we want to restrict the dataset to <span style="color:rgb(218, 1, 1);">latin characters</span>. Thank you so much! </li>
    <li>We find that some Turkers are making mistakes with image indexes. This would propagate error to our post-processing stage and your super nice annotations could be lost! 
        So please <span style="color:rgb(218, 1, 1);">double check that you are selecting the correct image indexes!</span> Images 1,2,3 are in the first row and images 4,5,6 are in the second row. Thank you so much! 
    </li>
    <li><span style="color:rgb(0, 98, 255);">We are actively finding new turkers because we're trying to scale up the dataset by an order of magnitude. 
        We'd appreciate it if you could try and get more turkers do our qualification task. Thank you in advance!</span><br>

    </li>
    <li>Mouse hover over an image doubles its size! We hope this may save you some time for opening a new tab.</li>
    <li>Please select <b>exactly two</b> images for the "multi-image" annotation. (optional for annotation 1 & 2, required for annotation 3) </li>
    <li>We are still experimenting with pricing, so please bear with us as we adjust price between runs.</li>
    <li>We are currently assuming 10-15 min / task, but we will try and adjust appropriately!</li>
</ul>
<br>
Please let us know if any aspect of this HIT is unclear. We will try and iterate together.<br>
