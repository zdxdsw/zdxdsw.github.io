<p>What kind of scenes depicted by the images do you think would make this task relatively easier? Your answer may or may not be limited to the scenes you have seen in our HITs.</p>

It's so great that you're all very actively suggesting good image categories for this task. Let's make the survey more interesting!
<p>What kind of images would you be happy to see in future annotations?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Animals? Zoo? Birds? Insects? Fish?</li>
    <li>Plants? Herbs? Flowers?</li>
    <li>Food? Dessert? Cuisines of different countries? (one concern is that most food doesn't have a unique name so it might be hard to avoid img-specific phrases)</li>
    <li>People involved in activities (apart from Olympics/holidays/military parades, any other suggestions?)</li>
    <li>Bands? Concerts? (this could only make sense when the exact time and location of a performance were provided)</li>
    <li>Different exhibits at museums?</li>
    <li>Robots (humanoid, animal-like)?</li>
    <li>Paintings? Portraits? Still-life? Religious scenes?</li>
    <li>Street arts? (again this could only make sense if the detailed street locations were available)</li>
    <li>Any other out-of-the-box ideas?</li>
</ul>
