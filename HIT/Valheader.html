<strong>Hi!</strong>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Mar 27 update: </strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>We add specialized input fields where you can write down more detailed justifications for problematic samples, as suggested by multiple Turkers.
            </li>
            <li>We fix the "unloading image" error. For single-image questions, the second placeholder is supposed to be hidden. 
                However, if you are still seeing this error, you can distinguish between whether it's caused by a broken URL or it's just a placeholder by mouse hovering and see if the tooltip bar showing up contains meaningful title or description. 
                An image with broken URL should have title and description, while a placeholder should have "None" as title/description. Sorry for the bug in our previous implementation!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Thank you for your help! Please let us know if any aspect of this HIT is unclear. We will try and iterate together. </li>
    <li>We are still experimenting with pricing, so please bear with us as we adjust price between runs.</li>
    <li>We are currently assuming <b>5 min / task</b>, but we will try and adjust appropriately!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Thank you in advance!</strong>
