<strong>Hi!</strong>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Apr 01 update: </strong> 
        <ul>
            Our instructions have caused some confusion so we'd like to clarify: <br>
            Actually, comparison questions asking to choose from two given names are allowed.  
            They are basically in the form "Which one between A and B has a more salient property C ". 
            At first sight, those questions seem to violate the requirement: "answer should not lie in metadata".
            But we think they are fine because 1) they require identifying visual properties mentioned in the question; 
            2) a list of options are given in the question so there is no need to retrieve the names from metadata. 
            <br>
            What we would like to discourage are those questions asking about something's name while having nothing to do with an image.
            For example, given an image of a castle in shanghai disneyland, 
            a question asks "What is the name of the castle in shanghai disneyland?". 
            The answer is "Enchanted Storybook Castle" but the given image is completely pointless. 
            Usually, the "answer from metadata" problem coincides with the "easy for text search" problem. 
            <br>
            Sorry again for the confusion.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>We add specialized input fields where you can write down more detailed justifications for problematic samples, as suggested by multiple Turkers.
    </li>
    <li>We fix the "unloading image" error. For single-image questions, the second placeholder is supposed to be hidden. 
        However, if you are still seeing this error, you can distinguish between whether it's caused by a broken URL or it's just a placeholder by mouse hovering and see if the tooltip bar showing up contains meaningful title or description. 
        An image with broken URL should have title and description, while a placeholder should have "None" as title/description. Sorry for the bug in our previous implementation!
    </li>
    <li>Thank you for your help! Please let us know if any aspect of this HIT is unclear. We will try and iterate together. </li>
    <li>We are still experimenting with pricing, so please bear with us as we adjust price between runs.</li>
    <li>We are currently assuming <b>5 min / task</b>, but we will try and adjust appropriately!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Thank you in advance!</strong>
