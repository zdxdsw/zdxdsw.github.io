We understand that the "multi-image" requirement for Annotation 3 is slightly difficult and time consuming. Here are some hints for you to do this task quickly. 
The key to doing this is <b>"compare and linking"</b>.
<ul style="margin-top:10px; list-style-type: '\1F4A1';">
    <li>&nbsp;If you identify the same object in two different images, think about how you can use that object as a "pivot" to <b>link</b> two images.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Find out whether two images share something in common, while there are still differences, so that you can ask a question to <b>compare</b> them.</li>
</ul>
