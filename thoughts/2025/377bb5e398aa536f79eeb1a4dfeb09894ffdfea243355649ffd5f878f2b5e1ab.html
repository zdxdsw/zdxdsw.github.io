              An emotional birthday week
            </h2>
            
            <div class="detail-box">
                <p>This Wednesday was my birthday. 
                </p><p>I had a cake party with claw lab where I accidentally told everyone that I'm searching for labs where I might find a sense of belonging 
                for my postdoc and the best options are Harvard and Princeton. I hope my labmates won't laugh at me if I don't end up at these places. 
                I know how hard it is.
                </p><p>Actually before the cake party we had a large group meeting (a research bonanza) where everyone had to do a 2min-2slides self-introduction. 
                I think what I did made some friends re-think whether they are the most OOD student in the lab.
                </p><p>I was very broken last week, but am very grateful this week. What happened? It's probably because … Jimin is leaving, Tiffany is finishing (her phd), 
                the spring is coming, I'm growing/aging … 
                </p><p>During this Thursday's meeting with Yonatan, I said I restored hope. Wenjie played a critical role in restoring my faith in that 
                people who appreciate my thinking actually exist in the world. So I've decided to do another round of search for these people. 
                I reflected upon why I fell into “tunnel vision” last week due to overexposure to LLM discussions. 
                I really hope that at some future point I'll be able to approach or interact with the LLM people in a friendly manner. 
                Currently I'm not able to do that. I always overreact, my wholesomeness always gets undermined… 
                because I have a fundamental fear that my corner is getting squeezed or vanishing. 
                When I said I started out with a moon, I cried again. Because I didn't have the confidence to say it until very very recently… until yesterday.
                </p><p>Yesterday was the <i>first</i> time I've ever said in public what I truly want. 
                By “in public” I mean in a professional-ish environment (conversations with my mom and dad and non-cs friends didn't count). 
                I also pointed out the struggles I'm facing, which is slicing off a reasonably-scoped question from the “monolith”, and sharpening the fuzzy picture. 
                After doing so I didn't feel bad!
                </p><p>This week was LTI's open house. I saw many new faces. I went to the open house room for free food. 
                Stacey said “come in and get food before the kids come down!” 
                </p><p>The “kids”. 
                </p><p>I can't help but wondering, who are they?
                </p><p>I met with an newly admitted student, Lucy. She approached Yonatan because of our recent papers.
                </p><p>She is right about many limitations of the current LLM paradigm.
                </p><p>I thought <b>the young are formidable</b>.
                </p><p>Pat Shafto visited CMU today. He was giving a talk at the math department.
                </p><p>Yonatan was meeting with Pat in the morning. I was like "&#x1F929; any opportunity for me to join?"
                </p><p>So I joined —— a conversation between two adults in the field.
                </p><p>Pat asked why not doing non-parametric bayesian for inductive generalization.
                </p><p>When I was working on the paper, I scrutinized the “old” community who did bayesian inference for induction, 
                in order to make sure that the problem that I was “defining” hadn't happened to be already solved by others. 
                And in the end, I was pretty sure that *the* induction problem which the “old” community studied is different from what I was talking about. 
                In fact, when I found out that, the classic ML people (e.g. Tom Mitchell) and the Bayesianist cognitive scientists talk about 
                two different things with identical terms: concept and induction…… I was like “wtf?” Well, I could see how they are related eventually, 
                but at first I was so confused and thought human language is NOT expressive AT ALL. This realization made me begin to seriously look for math. 
                I guess this is a good transition.
                </p><p>We reached one conclusion that Pat, Yonatan, and me represent three stages of an academic career. 
                Yet we all face the challenge of not being able to find the right community. <b>The challenge persists.</b> I'm happy to face this reality. 
                This affirms my belief that the moon doesn't exist <i>a priori</i> but only comes into existence when enough people start shooting for it.
                </p><p>At noon I went to the math department for Pat's talk.
                </p><p>The talk was given in a very small conference room. This was in stark contrast to talks in SCS. 
                E.g. last week Ken Goldberg came and the talk happened in an auditorium.
                </p><p>But I like the intimate vibes of a small conference room. I felt like: oh, this is the <i>math</i> department, 
                full of people higher above me up <i>the mountain</i>.
                </p><p>In the evening, I did myself a huge disfavor by pulling up the very earliest chat history between me and Yonatan, 
                both on slack and gmail. Then I cried like shit. Back then I addressed Yonatan as “Dr. Bisk”. 
                Back then I had options to choose Alex Hauptmann or Jamie Callan as my advisor. 
                </p><p>When I just finished undergrad and didn't know nothing, I had only one criteria for my future advisor: 
                I didn't want my mental health to be permanently destroyed during my PhD.
                </p><p>I have probably evaluated Yonatan based on vibes as well. In our first zoom meeting, I remembered he had a side swept bang and 
                he wore a headset like a DJ. Then I decided: This person! He's the <i>least</i> likely to destroy my mental health.</p>
                <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-sm-10 offset-sm-1"><div class="img-box"><img src="images/screenshot1.png" alt=""><br><br></div></div>
                <p>I told Yonatan I ranked him as my first choice after &quot;a long time of consideration&quot; and after &quot;communication with several other faculties&quot; 
                and after he told me &quot;Alex is likely a better choice :&rpar;&quot;.</p>
                <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-sm-10 offset-sm-1"><div class="img-box"><img src="images/screenshot2.png" alt=""><br><br></div></div>
                <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-sm-10 offset-sm-1"><div class="img-box"><img src="images/screenshot3.png" alt=""><br><br></div></div>
                <p>Actually I completely forgot how I managed to “make” Yonatan admit me in the first place.
                But as I re-read those emails, I realized, damn, I accidentally hit all the correct buzzwords in my first email. 
                Maybe that was what I heard him rambling in the Gathertown.</p>
                <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-sm-10 offset-sm-1"><div class="img-box"><img src="images/screenshot4.png" alt=""><br><br></div></div>
                <p>After I jointed Yonatan's lab, I immediately threw away all those buzzwords and became a weird kid. 
                </p><p>I refused to touch an actual robot. I dismissed language-vision models (as not being able to do true reasoning). 
                I've never touched a simulator environment, let alone a real one. I attacked Transformers, end-to-end, sparks of AGI 
                and made fun of multimodal agents. I think most language people live in a giant lie and CV is a parentless field.
                </p><p>But at the end of the day I was hopeless and felt inferior because nobody understood what I want, 
                nobody was able to engage in a discussion that I truly like, or told me how to do the type of research that I truly admire. 
                </p><p>I always know I have a moon but I don't even have the right language to describe it. Neither have I found the language. 
                I was just circling around and doubting forever whether the moon actually exists.
                </p><p>This morning Yonatan told Pat that we just saw the transition lately where I became able to do research meetings with my self 
                (and with a whiteboard). I explained that previously I relied on Yonatan to give me the momentum. 
                But the friction was too large that my momentum would quickly vanish after every meeting. 
                In contrast, now I'm able to self-maintain that momentum and generate next actions. 
                Yonatan was like: that's why you should leave. I only work with people who can't do that yet.
                </p><p>In the afternoon I met Jacob to give feedback on his <i>first</i> paper in which he proposed a new embodied spatial reasoning dataset. 
                I realized I was unintentionally treating him as an “advisee” when he sent me his abstract last night but I shouldn't. 
                I should treat him as a labmate, so I tried today. 
                He also told me he wanted to do some MI research because mechanistically understanding V/LLMs would be very cool. 
                People keep finding the same thing as “the cool thing”. 
                </p><p>This made me think about the art of advising again.
                During PhD I have been trained (i.e. forced) to form opinions, scientifically communicate my opinions, 
                and sell my opinions publicly, firmly and professionally.
                </p><p>But IF I become a professor at some future point, I should hold my opinions in front of my students. 
                I want my future students to develop their own opinions from scratch. 
                So I guess per the MI discussion I will encourage Jacob to read more about MI and to continue looking for the gems and that's it. 
                </p><p>Also if ever a fresh graduate student approaches me because of Model Successor Functions, 
                I will tell them no no no this is the wrong entrance to the field. You should enter the field through Experience Grounds Language.</p>
