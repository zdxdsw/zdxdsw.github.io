              What if one day Yonatan stops to …
                <p><br>&emsp;&emsp;1. send me papers
                <br>&emsp;&emsp;2. have research meetings with me</p>
            </h2>
            
            <div class="detail-box">
                <p>I started to think about 1 since last summer (2024) and it was a pretty benign thought. 
                It was until I updated this list with 2 that the <code>what-if-one-day-Yonatan-stops-to</code> question template 
                started to suggest something scary. Back in last summer, I was just feeling grateful for the fact that 
                I don't have to check Twitter regularly for paper feeds. Apparently I'm not happy with the 
                signal-to-noise ratio on any social media and I would constantly get distracted by annoying people/information 
                if I have to check Twitter myself. Thankfully Yonatan does that filtering for me and 
                for a long time Yonatan was my sole high-quality information source (research-wise). 
                A change naturally emerged last winter when I can keep expanding the frontier of the literature I entertain with. 
                I also remembered that last winter a friend asked me how I find papers to read, 
                and I didn't know how to answer it. Perhaps part of the answer is “Yonatan and other people on slack send me papers”, 
                and another part is "I just know them … from tracing the citations of papers I read previously, 
                or from tracing the authors I already know of, … " My reading list is always longer than what 
                I'm happy about so I'm always working on shortening my reading list and have never faced, or felt the need to ponder, 
                the problem of not knowing where to find relevant papers. Today I saw a student asking on slack how people set up paper alerts 
                to receive good paper feeds, and I jokingly replied with “no alert and enjoy peace”. 
                </p><p>So I guess I'm smoothly transitioning past 1, but 2 is much more difficult. 
                I find myself rejecting every thought that one day I will no longer have regular research meetings with Yonatan. 
                And because I'm rejecting the thought, it becomes an invasive thought. 
                There's only one year left where we will have regular research meetings and this is <i>very much unacceptable</i>.
                </p><p>I initially thought this is only remotely related to the task of separation. 
                But maybe deep down they are intricately intertwined. I don't think I gracefully dealt with separation with my parents. 
                It was done in a chaotic way. Back then my parents didn't catch my emotions. 
                My emotions were dropped to the ground, deemed as a sign of immaturity and rejected. 
                And definitely I still haven't got over the trauma. I don't blame my parents for not being able to catch my emotions, 
                but I do blame the world for mercilessly letting them drop to the ground. The consequence is I attach a great amount of 
                complicated emotions to concepts like airplane, airport, security check, immigration check, customs, or even airport express train. 
                I'm unwilling to connect the two things — (a) separation from my parents and (b) separation from Yonatan, 
                (or broadly speaking, from my “home institution”) — together. But I do see they are the same demon dressed up in different costumes.
                </p><p>There are several differences this time, however, the first two on my side, the third one on my fear's side.
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;1. I foresee it, which means I can prepare for it, starting now.
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;2. I am much <i>less</i> helpless now.
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;3. I have more uncertainty about my future, or I would say this time the uncertainty is of a harder category, 
                  e.g. it is about the next city I'm gonna live in, the next institution I'm gonna work at, the next interpersonal circle...
                </p><p>3 is lethal. I'm worried that I'll end up at a place I don't like, or I don't feel belong. 
                Perhaps what I can do now is nothing else but focusing on increasing my value so I'll have more bargain power in the near future. 
                </p><p>As I tried to single out causes of my separation anxiety, I figured a major one is the “nobody cares” issue.  
                Deep down in my fear is the feeling that one day nobody would care about me, my research, my progress in building my academic career. 
                I think one day no one would check in about “how's it going?”, or “am I doing ok?”. 
                And that day's approaching scares me a lot. 
                </p><p>I think one way to stop myself being bothered that much by this fear is to <b>write a single-authored paper</b>, and publish it! 
                This is the way to get truly independent. I need to go through all the processes alone: 
                fighting for the ddl, the rebuttal, perhaps, probably, the resubmission, then rebuttal again, … 
                under the condition that there's nobody checking in on how it's going and whether I'm doing ok. 
                </p><p>Here are examples of single-authored manuscripts that I admire and try to emulate. </p>
                <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-sm-10 offset-sm-1"><div class="img-box"><img src="images/singleauthored2.png" alt=""><br><br></div></div>
                <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-sm-10 offset-sm-1"><div class="img-box"><img src="images/singleauthored3.png" alt=""><br><br></div></div>
                <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-sm-10 offset-sm-1"><div class="img-box"><img src="images/singleauthored.png" alt=""><br><br></div></div>
                <p>Perhaps there is also something to learn from my experience in dealing with separation from my parents. 
                For example, those airport-related concepts no longer trigger pure sorrow or utter helplessness. They got overwritten with new memories about travel. 
                Yep —> <b>always leverage my success in dealing with physical distance to deal with mental distance!</b> 
                Why can I solo-travel to a new place with no acquaintance and function well? 
                Nobody cares about when my plane takes off, whether I get to the hotel before it's too late, or whether I enjoy the scenery. 
                But I'm ok with it and actually enjoy it. I think this is a rather nice base case which I've already laid, firmly. 
                I only need to work out the inductive case. I know there's a qualitative difference, though. 
                That is, traveling doesn't shift your anchor. But starting a new life chapter requires changing your anchor, which feels much more dreadful. 
                Especially, I feel like, this time nobody will be catching you at the new anchor. 
                <b><i>I have to either catch myself, or grow the ability to gracefully land</i></b>. 
                </p><p>Having all that said (Apr1 2025), I must start right now <b>doing everything that can be a favor for the future me</b>. 
                Paramount above all, I must strive for a new anchor which makes me excited.
                </p><p>Today (Apr2 2025) as I was doing the cliff walk in Newport, I came up with a fourth coping strategy: <b>internalizing Yonatan</b>. 
                Though I know I can never 100% accomplish this, nor can I even get close to 30%, 
                it doesn't stop me from getting excited about applying this strategy because it will be the most powerful one in weakening the impact of separation 
                — if only I could take part of it with me wherever I go. In fact I've had this thought before but didn't take it very seriously. 
                Nor did I flesh it out into a serious plan that calls for changes in my behavior. I guess I will do it this time then.
                </p><p>One of the concrete actions is doing mock advisor meeting before the real advisor meeting where I pretend to be both me and Yonatan, 
                the annoying Yonatan💢 especially. I will try this out starting from next week (Apr7-13) and see how it feels! 
                Next week I plan to write three versions of my thesis abstract and ask for feedback! During the mock meeting I will think about what questions 
                Yonatan may ask and if he indeed asks them, I'll complain about him being so predictable. 
                </p><p>The benefit of doing the mock meetings more seriously and deliberately is that they will become valid data points. 
                And oracle signals will be obtained from the real advisor meetings. Then I'll have contrastive pairs. 
                I have one year from now on to collect contrastive pairs and refine my already-good-in-some-sense internalization. Wow I'm excited about it! 
                Having worked with Yonatan for five years, I have developed a reasonable belief model of him, but it is far from complete. 
                This is because Yonatan's mind is deeply profound. It's also exactly for this reason that internalizing my advisor is a fun, challenging and endless game!
                </p><p>In summary I've figured out four ways to tackle the <code>what-if-one-day-Yonatan-stops-to</code> problem.
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;1. Start doing the right things, now! They are favors to the future me.
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;2. Take on the mission of writing a single-authored paper (probably after graduation)
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;3. Reflect upon how I become perfectly okay with traveling alone when nobody cares.
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;4. Internalize Yonatan</p>
