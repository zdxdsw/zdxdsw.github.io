              If a looming future is too frightening to even think of, then the way to concur fear is to start thinking about it. 
            </h2>
            
            <div class="detail-box">
                <p>I recently realized that those who pursue an academic career go on the job market 
                in their last PhD year. For me, this timeline will start from this October. 
                I'm entirely freaked out!!!!! I always think that I will work two years as a postdoc to become more independent in research. 
                But, actually, those who did postdocs before starting their faculty job usually started their postdoc 
                <i>after they had already got the faculty offer</i>. So a postdoc by no means delays the time by which 
                you go on the national tour and do your job talk! I'm completely freaked out!!!!!
                </p><p>I can see there are two paths: tenure track faculty vs. full time researcher at a research institute. 
                But I don't know whether they are truly in parallel, or they can be organized temporally one after another, 
                or they actually share a lot of requirements in common so I should better put eggs simultaneously in two baskets. 
                I realized that I've been putting eggs in the basket of full-time researcher / postdoc fellow <i>in order to</i> 
                buy more time for preparing to become a tenure track faculty. I wonder whether this is utterly wrong. 
                </p><p>I can almost see it'll inevitably happen in the upcoming summer that 
                Yonatan say it's time for me to go on the job market. 
                Perhaps he already sees my fear and hesitation, so he's waiting/looking for the righting timing to bring it up. 
                </p><p>But my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085MJGYH4?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2&th=1" target="_blank">prophetic calendar</a> says <b>everything I want is on the other side of fear</b>.
                </p><p>I want to discuss with Yonatan more about applying to research institutes / postdoctoral fellowships, 
                and whether it makes more sense to me. I remembered Yonatan mentioning the most prolific mathematician 
                as an example in which he'd like to see me playing out my own version. 
                So does it mean this should happen before I look for a tenure track faculty job? 
                I do think his example makes a lot of sense. But I want more solid reasons! 
                I don't want to do it merely for the sake of buying more time or, even worse, out of (self-imposed) fear that I'm not ready. 
                </p><p>Indeed, I want to write more papers as the first author, before I get distracted by 
                the mundane (if necessary) part of teaching and departmental duties. 
                I want to focus on research per se and building my networks, meeting more people with their moons, 
                people who are responsible, trustworthy, and do science with their heart. 
                </p><p>Moreover, there are several things I want to accomplish as a <i>core propeller</i> rather than as an “advisor”. 
                I haven't done a workshop, I haven't published single-authored papers. 
                I haven't written papers with equally-well-trained researchers from different backgrounds. 
                I think if I start a tenure track faculty job too early I'd miss many opportunities of doing these things, am I correct?  
                </p><p>Are these reasons real reasons? Are these reasons solid reasons? 
                If it turns out that all these are just manifestations of my fear then 
                I'd change my mind, try stop making these up and instead working on my fear. 
                </p><p>If I apply for those fellowships, what do I need to prepare? 
                What's the alternative of the job talk? Maybe I should create the story I want to tell via my thesis 
                and form my thesis committee <i>asap</i>. <b>Only in this way can more nice things fall into place</b>, if they ever show up. ✊
                </p><p>Things getting out of control is part of the right track. 
                Fear accumulating to a point where it seems insurmountable is part of the right track. 
                I should treat writing my thesis abstract, or the one pager two pager thing, 
                or the “think big” proposal thing, as seriously as I deal with hard rebuttal ddls and <b>GO</b>. </p>
