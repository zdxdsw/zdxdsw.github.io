              There is an uncanny tunnel where I do not know what I need.

              </p><br><hr><br><p> &#127930; Perhaps I should add color to my life, but running back to distractions is no remedy.<br>
              Perhaps I should add sound to my life, but filling the silence muffles the faintest whisper.<br>
              Perhaps I should find an exit, but the walls are echoing back what meant to be heard. <br>
              Perhaps I should take it easy with the fog, but I'm drawn to what's beyond and what has always lurked.

              Perhaps I should be more assertive, but it's hard to tell it apart from being stubborn.<br>
              Perhaps I should take more time to think it through, but that could be a disguise for procrastination, and now the disguise is blown. <br>
              Perhaps I should keep searching for what I want, but why am I so hard to be pleased? I hear my own scorn.
              </p><p> &#129412; Perhaps I should reunite with what I walked away from, but I fear it would undo all the effort.<br>
              Perhaps I should make peace with what I've long fought, but the image of the boiling frog frightens me more. <br>
              Perhaps I should cultivate a sense of home, but home cannot harbor the ambition to sail far.<br>
              Perhaps I should slow down, but I've forgotten how to rest, and trying to rest exhausts me more.

              </p><br><hr><br><p>
                I ran across someone else's writing that strikes me as brutally accurate: 
                "At this point I honestly can't tell whether I need a hug, ten bottles of beer, a visit to a shrink, six months of sleep, or an exit from life courtesy of a passing car."
              </p><p> 
                There is distortion in my sensing, dissonance in my cognition, and contradiction in my reasoning. 
              </p><p>I have renormalized everything so I no longer know what's normal. 
              </p><p>
                I have strayed so far from my old sense of comfort that familiarity itself becomes unfamiliar.
              </p><p>
                I've asked for support, but advice offered by others feel like nuggets too small to light up the vast hole.
              </p><p>
                A voice inside keeps murmuring “it's the last stretch, it's the last stretch …” But after a thousand proposed “last stretches”, belief has faded. Yet I fear that my unbelief would disappoint my soul.
              </p><br><hr><br><p>
                Perhaps I simply need help, help in every imaginable sense. 
              </p><p>
                Also perhaps I simply need nothing but being present with myself. 
              </p><p>
                Perhaps I simply need truth. A truth that illuminates why I see distressing dead-ends everywhere.
